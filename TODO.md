# TODO

- Config deploy to build Angular frontend
- Create automated tests
- Maybe use Nx to manage monorepo and share code between backend and frontend
- Use database migrations
- Use slug in /condos/:id and all subpaths
- Create table: provider_account (e.g., ewelink, tuya etc.) -- link it to devices
- Use /api as base path for all routes
- Create Angular frontend

# Decisions

- All (or most) tables must have createdAt and updatedAt columns
